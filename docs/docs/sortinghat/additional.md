# What more can SortingHat do

- <strong>Lock a profile</strong><br>
  SortingHat provides the ability to lock a profile. That is, no merge/delete/edit can be acccomplish with that particular profile.

  Note: _Profile can be unlocked by clicking on the lock icon again_<br><br>

  - After creating a profile, hover right next to the profile's name and a set of icons will appear. Click on the following icon to mark it as bot, <img src="../../../assets/sortinghat-bot.png" alt="sortinghat-bot" style="width:20px;"/> &nbsp;
