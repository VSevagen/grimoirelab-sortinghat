# How to remove a profile

Every profile in the <code>Indivduals</code> table will have &nbsp; <img src="../../../assets/sortinghat-option-icon.png" alt="sortinghat-option-icon" style="width:25px;"/> &nbsp; icon which opens up a tab with several options, including <strong>Delete profile</strong>. Clicking on "Delete profile" will open a pop-up where you'll have to confirm that you really want to delete this profile. If yes, press <strong>Confirm</strong>. This will remove the individual in question from SortingHat.<br>

In the case several profiles need to be removed, they can be selected and deleted in batches using the delete button, &nbsp; <img src="../../../assets/sortinghat-delete.png" alt="sortinghat-delete" style="width:75px;"/> &nbsp;
